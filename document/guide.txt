Catherine Framework
Guide to 2015-09-02

First, I would like to thank you for using the Catherine framework, which will help you get started with the basics of the Catherine framework.

1: Basic knowledge of the Catherine framework

The Catherine framework is a one-year Role Play (RP) framework, yet its functionality is immature, but it will become the best framework.
To get to know the Catherine framework completely, you need to have a basic knowledge, first of all you should be aware of the differences between the framework and the schema.

The framework is... The framework is a skeleton in English, that is, it is easy to say that it is in base mode. Typically, it is a framework such as Nutscript (Nut Script) or Clockwork (Clockwork).

Schema... Schema can easily be said to be an extension mode that frees the framework. For example, HL2RP (Half-Life 2 RP) or Modern RP might be called Schema.

The Catherine framework is basically written in the Lua script language. If you are not familiar with the Lua script, see the link below.

Official Lua Document, Official Gary Mode Wiki

If you use the Catherine framework and discover a bug, please complete a support ticket or contact the developer directly.

Note If you are contacting the developer directly, please include your comment in the SteamProfile comment, even briefly.

2: Catherine framework and schema installation, behavior

You must first download the Catherine framework and schema files.

NOTE Schema files may be authored / shared by external authors

Download the Catherine framework and Schema files, and unzip them.

➨ Catherine Framework: Download
➨ HL2RP (Half-Life 2 RP) Schema: Download

You should now see the following folder structure.

➡ Catherine-master> gamemode, framework, content, entities, document, catherine.txt, database_config.cfg, README.md
➡ Catherine-HL2RP-master> gamemode, schema, content, entities, cat_hl2rp.txt, README.md

Change the name of the folder to the name of the mode text file in the folder.

Catherine-master ➡ catherine
Catherine-HL2RP-master ➡ cat_hl2rp

And paste it into 'garrysmod / gamemodes' on your source-only server, so the folder structure in 'garrysmod / gamemodes' on your source-only server looks like this:

Gamemodes:
➨ catherine
➨ cat_hl2rp
➨ base (default game mode)
➨ sandbox (default game mode)
➨ terrortown (default game mode)

NOTE If you do not have a source-only server, you need to create a new one.

You may also need to install the content file if the schema contains a content folder. Copy all the folders in the content folder and then install it by inserting it into the "garrysmod /" of your dedicated source server.

Now that you have the files installed, set the startup option command line for your source-only server to + gamemode 'schema folder name' before running the server.

Yes + gamemode cat_hl2rp

NOTE Refer to the link for setting the startup options for the source-only server.

WARNING Absolute Start Options Do not set the game mode setting on the command line to catherine, you must set it to Schema.

The Catherine framework and Schema installation is complete.













3: Database (optional)

NOTE This is optional, and the Catherine framework is fully functional without database setup.

If you look in the Catherine Framework mode folder, you will find the database_config.cfg file, which defines the information needed to access the database. If you open the file in Notepad or Notepad ++, you can find the following code:

- Catherine Database Config

Local CONFIG = {}

CONFIG.DATABASE_MODULE = "sqlite" - Database module ID (sqlite, mysqloo, tmysql4)
CONFIG.DATABASE_HOST = "127.0.0.1" - Database host IP / name for connect.
CONFIG.DATABASE_ID = "root" - Database account ID for authentication.
CONFIG.DATABASE_PASSWORD = "" - Database account Password for authentication.
CONFIG.DATABASE_NAME = "" - Database table name.
CONFIG.DATABASE_PORT = 3306 - Database Port for connect. (Number)

Return CONFIG













CONFIG.DATABASE_MODULE

NOTE If you set CONFIG.DATABASE_MODULE to sqlite, the following settings are not required.

4: Setting value

The path to the settings file for the Catherine framework and schema is:

➨ Catherine framework: 'framework / config / framework_config.lua'
➨ Schema: 'schema / sh_config.lua'

NOTE The settings of the Catherine framework are overridden by the schema settings.

5: Initializing the database

To uninitialize the Catherine framework or initialize the database at your own discretion, try the following:

Common methods (SQLite, MySQL)

With the source-only server turned on, run the 'cat_db_init' command on the console and restart the server.

WARNING Try when there is no player on the server, database initialization
It can cause unexpected serious errors.



Passive Method (MySQL)

If the normal method does not work, use a MySQL database management system on systems that use the MySQL database.

WARNING Always attempt to shut down the server completely.



Passive Method (SQLite)

Systems that use an SQLite database should attempt this method if the normal method does not work.

Go to the folder where the source-only server is installed.
Locate the sv.db file inside the garrysmod folder.
Delete the sv.db file

WARNING Always attempt to shut down the server completely.

Warning This method erases all data stored in the SQLite database.



WARNING Deleted databases can not be recovered, please choose carefully.


6: Authentication code

To use Katharine, you need a verification code, which is to protect Katharine's content from the server owner who has unkind use and an incorrect mind.
